## Technologies Used:
This project is built using the following technologies:

- Three.js: A powerful JavaScript library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser, which forms the core of the game’s visuals.
- JavaScript (ES6): The primary language used for scripting the game logic and interactions.
- HTML5 & CSS3: For structuring and styling the webpage.
- Webpack: For bundling the project’s modules and assets.
